I'm working my way through the <i>Iliad,</i> but I'm not used to the archaic writing style. I'm reading passages and then parsing through the Spark Notes to make sure I'm understanding it. I'm also taking notes on it so I can remember the details I like.

Today, I made okra fry and helped my mother make lentil soup. I love that I have more free time now because I can make dishes with my mother every day. I like the confidence of knowing what I'm doing. I hope to find that level of ease around everything I do.
